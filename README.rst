Pygplib: Python First-Order Graph Property Library
==================================================

|PyPI Version| |Python Versions| |Test| |Coverage| |License| |Documentation|

Introduction
============

``Pygplib`` (Python First-Order Graph Property Library) is a Python module 
for constructing, manipulating, and encoding graph properties expressible 
with first-order logic of graphs.
It serves as a prototyping tool to tackle with 
various graph related applications.
It provides access to state-of-the-art satisfiability technologies 
without advanced knowledge.
Basic steps to follow are :

- Express a graph property of interest as a first-order formula.
- Set a graph structure, and encode a first-order formula into CNF, 
  a canonical normal form for propositional formulas.
- Apply satisfiability tools to the CNF to compute satisfying
  assignments.
- Decode the result into an assignment of first-order variables.

  abstract = {This paper presents a unified framework for capturing a variety of graph reconfiguration problems in terms of firstorder expressible properties and proposes a Boolean encoding for formulas in the first-order logic of graphs based on the exploitation of fundamental properties of graphs. We show that a variety of graph reconfiguration problems captured in our framework can be computed in a unified way by combining our encoding and Boolean satisfiability solver in a bounded model checking approach but allowing us to use quantifiers and predicates on vertices to express reconfiguration properties.},
